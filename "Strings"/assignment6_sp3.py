#Assume an input string s of any length where all letters are lowercase.
#Write code which prints the index location of each letter 'o' in the string, one location per line of output.

#Hint: enumerate() is your friend!

#Given the string s = 'happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. - gandhi'
#the output will be:

#24
#40
#58
#62
#75

s = input("Input a string: ")
target = "o"

for index,letter in enumerate(s):
    if letter ==target:
        print(index)
